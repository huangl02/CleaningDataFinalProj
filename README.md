#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, runAnalysis.R, does the following:

    Download the zip data in the working directory 
    Unzip the file
    Load the activity_labels and feature
    Load and merge (by columns) all the files in the training dataset (i.e. X_train, y_train, and subject_train)
    Load and merge (by columns) all the files in the test dataset (i.e. X_test, y_test, and subject_test)
    Merge (by rows) the training and test datasets
    Rename all the column names (1st column called "subject", 2nd column called "activity", the pass feature.txt 
    to the rest of the column names
    Change all the values in activity column to the actual activity names listed in activity_labels.txt
    Keep only those columns which contain a mean() or standard deviation std()
    Creates a tidy dataset that contains the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and each activity.

The end result is shown in the file secondDataSet.txt.

Experiemental Design:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
